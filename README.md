Nowadays, parallel robots are used popularly in industry because of its flexibility, high rigidity and high loading capacity. However, in contrast of those benefits, they still exist main drawbacks as small workspace interrupted by singularity zones. This project attempts to study how a parallel robot based on 5-bar linkage works. In quadruped robot locomotion using parallel mechanisms, researchers have used equal link lengths as legs for walking. However, force requirements are not the same in the forward and return strokes. Major issues include conceiving a 5-bar linkage, designing a 2-DOF parallel robot through workspace synthesis, singularity analysis and structure design, implementing a prototype and control system. System operation as well as experimental results validate this approach.
